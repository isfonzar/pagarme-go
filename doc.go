// Package pagarme is a Pagarme SDK for the Go programming language.
//
// The Pagarme SDK for Go provides APIs and utilities that developers can use to
// build Go applications that use Pagarme services.
//
// The SDK removes the complexity of coding directly against a web service
// interface. It hides a lot of the lower-level plumbing, such as authentication,
// request retries, and error handling.
